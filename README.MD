# Python Mini Projects

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

This repository marks the start of my journey into **professional programming** with Python.  
Here, Iâ€™ll be building a collection of **small but complete projects** to strengthen my understanding of Python and prepare myself for more advanced work in **AI, robotics, and web development** in the future.
